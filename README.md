# Lab7
Audrey Suit
 The purpose of this lab was to demonstrate connecting the Arduino IDE software with the GitHub Desktop app. 

GitHub Desktop is valuable for connecting with existing codes and software on the computer. It syncs effectively between the two and then uploads to GitHub online.
For our purposes, this would expedite our lab reports when we code on Arduino IDE. We could more easily sync our code to our GitHub repository.

In conclusion, moving forward, this was valuable software to familiarize myself with. It is an efficient process that we can integrate into future labs.
